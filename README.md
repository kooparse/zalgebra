<br/>
<br/>
Linear algebra library for games and computer graphics.

The goal is to become as complete and useful as the Unity one. I'm currently using it for my projects and will continue to update it as new needs are coming.

If you would like to contribute, don't hesitate! :)

Note: **The main branch is for the latest Zig release (0.14.x), use [latest](https://github.com/kooparse/zalgebra/tree/latest) for latest master changements**

## Examples

Example of usage is located at [example/](example/).

```zig
const za = @import("zalgebra");
const Vec3 = za.Vec3;
const Mat4 = za.Mat4;

pub fn main () void {
  const projection = za.perspective(45.0, 800.0 / 600.0, 0.1, 100.0);
  const view = za.lookAt(Vec3.new(0.0, 0.0, -3.), Vec3.zero(), Vec3.up());
  const model = Mat4.fromTranslate(Vec3.new(0.2, 0.5, 0.0));

  const mvp = Mat4.mul(projection, view.mul(model));
  mvp.debugPrint();
}
```
